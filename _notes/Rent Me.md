As high as a kite
Head over heals
New kid on a block
Hocus pocus
At the drop of a hat
Beat a dead horse
Bite your tongue
Chew someone out
Get up on the wrong side of the bed
Saved by the bell
New York minute
Crack someone up
Cock and bull story
Out of line
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Till the cows come home
The best of both worlds
Excuse my french,
Rent me
Mmm... 
Rent me
