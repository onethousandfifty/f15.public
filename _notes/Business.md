I think you're right 
Wonderful dream 
The heavy traffic 
Short and sweet 
It was quite a weird 
Feeling in my chest 
Imagine how horrified & embarrassed their faces
Don’t get me wrong 
Stitch a plain Slim Shady 
Counterfeit business 

Everyone wants to feel special
А smile of a black widow spread love It’s not in my line of business 
Makes you look like your mom 

This business seriously I lied to a friend 
He didn’t feel pain 
Surreal serpentine 
More balanced between pseudo-critiques 
You got your loyalties 
One by one now dangerous for health 
That seems insidious to me during the president’s speech 

Marlboro Light 
Your rage geyser 
Ultra-elite in the ’80s 
The plot, like a wrapper from a candy 
To fail a test it’s okay 
Who live double lives? Didn’t work out 
Read your e-mails 
People dolphins 
It wouldn’t be taboo 
To slam someone 
Tone-deaf and tasteless 

This business seriously 
I lied to a friend 
He didn’t feel pain 
Surreal serpentine 
More balanced between pseudo-critiques 
You got your loyalties 
One by one now 
Dangerous for health 
That seems insidious to me 
About religions and sex 

Shuffle the cards 
Gun to the temple 
I can't remember all 
Give me a little time 
Simple anatomy 
Fictive producer 
Breakout home star 
You’re just using me 

It's a win 
No more sex 
Knife on polyethylene 
It's business 
Fake
Fake 

It's a win-win 
Find them at the crime scene 
It's business 
Little chance...
I couldn’t help 

Mom bought me a PC 
Life colorful 
Water cuts metal like oil 
I’m the reason you’re here 
Queens had been squeezed 
The voice of a man that sounds in children's American cartoons 
Write out all kinds of words 
That you can describe a business
Business
