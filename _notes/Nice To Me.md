Living so short, 
I’ll kiss your lips last time 
Just sick and tired of your friends 
My name is a lie, your name is okay 

Let’s do it if you want to watch Unlucky emotional scars 
I guess I found my hope 
Thanks, for being nice to me

Fade out, but I’m trying to enjoy every second 
What I need is to create when we’re going blind way 

Friends Team 
Between November 17th until December 15 
I'm sure it's not true
Mama Mia, I think of you 
All signs of a panic attack 
I was young when I first heard that song 
The clip exploded online 
Screaming voice don’t touch my child 

Let’s do it if you want to watch Unlucky emotional scars I guess I found my hope 
Thanks, for being nice to me 

Defeat me I wanna look at you 
The dark time has passed I wanna look at you 
A funnel that untwists the frames 
I can think it was all okay 

My friend take care of my loss 
First negative comment 
In a long-playing record 
Just take a screenshot 
And don’t delete 
The singer took to the stage 

Television everywhere is closed for an hour. 

Let’s do it if you want to watch Unlucky emotional love 
I guess I found my hope 
Thanks, for being nice to me
