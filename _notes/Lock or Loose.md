Your enemies’ tears are a good thing 
Indelible ink appears on and off 
Forever unfettered 
African elephant 
Chemical element... cut it short

Titillate you to death 
Sounds of sex
Forsake the heartache 
Lying in wait for a new testament 
Always afraid

Keep an eye on a trumpeter swan
And I knew it’s a sin
They would never ever understand being happy is not easy for him 
It trembles with fear

Secret polygon
War criminal
Excited push
Is killing my vibe 
Smeared popcorn
The day you were born
In the movie pure evil сomes apart

Keep an eye on a trumpeter swan
And I knew it’s a sin
They would never ever understand being happy is not easy for him 
It trembles with fear

The crow doesn’t pick out the crown 
Please help to promote my war

I’d rather be killed by you 
Gain wings and fly away 
What is it to you?
In the new heart rhythm

Nothing shameful
Children believe in omens
Only a moment
Speaking to the point 
Celebrate a flight of the bird 
Which was cured and sheltered 
Separate silhouettes
I see a face on the bottom of the sea 
Such colorful dreams
And no one has access to it 
Take a cold shower
The little boy can’t kill

I hate you boy
Psychopathic predator in a sleeveless hoodie 
Grief is equally fabricated
He hits the bull’s - eye 
Phenomenal orgasm impression
Everyday entertain on the electroplate 
Masquerade is insane 
Irreversibility of events and consequences 
And I knew that you were here with him 
And I knew it’s a sin
