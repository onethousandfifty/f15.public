A gold lamé suit
Reminds me to block nicotine
I thought I had failed this
The situation is really sad

Maybe I wanted to try to stumble
She's afraid of the front camera
Don't let me bleed, I'm just a husband for the hour

I’m just a fool
Due to our poor
Communication
In the past

Mutation
In my veins
Mutation
In my heart

The fool
Pulling behavior but attracting the fool
The fool
Fools I do attract with my pull and my act

I Google her cover in Vogue like a fool
Highest card held by winners
She morphs into a beast
Smashing to pieces
Chainsaw draws us away 
When the trap door gets stuck
I mean nothing and nothing
Reaping my benefits
