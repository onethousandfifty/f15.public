Congratulations  
You've successfully changed me  
Black lipstick on my face is too much  
Your own religions, glad to be an actor  
We are the stars in the red skies  
  
I write my first post on Twitter today  
Can you count how many of me are here  
I can't imagine what will happen next  
But no, my friend, right now you can't play  
In my Sony Playstation  
  
Keeping things cool and start collecting  
Money for flying in space. Later  
A short letter, that I'm cooking an open fire  
So. It was all a fake  
  
Yes, I'm ready for this  
The place to release stress in the dance  
Balance your race and feel the speed  
It's hurt you. Welcome on a trip  
  
Touch my melodies with your hand  
They were woven to be touched by you  
Ignore the fact that another's hated my point of view  
It's a «Safe Heaven» I found a missing line  
Into the wrong hands. Well, fine  
Different style, but so much better  
Then you guys have a now  
  
It's a «Safe Heaven» I found a missing line  
Into the wrong hands. Well, fine  
Telecommunications give me a laser gun  
  
Because every moment of this song has died  
We had fun so was close to you  
I don't want to know that you want to write to me  
There's only something I wouldn't want to read  
  
Congratulations  
You've successfully changed me  
Black lipstick on my face is too much  
Your own religions, glad to be an actor  
We are the stars in the red skies
