Force looks like fire
Strange symbol
And you’re still mine
I show the force
Force conquers fear
You’re always mine
I always win
Make it with love

All my likes disappeared, my likes
I have lost all the likes, my likes
All my likes disappeared, oh God
Give me back all my likes!
Give me all my likes back
