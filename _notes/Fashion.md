Your smile thick and curvy 
It will freak you out 
How to erase it before God saw it? Stop. 
He doesn't know me 

Fashion is the way 
Your jawline meets your neck, 
Which meets your collarbone to Extend your larynx upright 
So you may speak about fashion 

Blood is fashion 
Brand names are not fashion 
Your skin and bones are fashion 
How fucking interesting tell me more Fear is crashing 
Tears of our pleasure 
Spacecraft suffer a crushing defeat 

Dead loop 
I can forget how I look from the side  If you see the future
You won’t be in your own skin

I'll turn into a butterfly when he compresses my head 
Kittens that we are must drown 
But I said him «No» 
Kissing by color of his tongue 

Blood is fashion 
Brand names are not fashion 
Your skin and bones are fashion 
How fucking interesting tell me more Fear is crashing Tears of our pleasure Spacecraft suffer a crushing defeat 

Kissing by color of him
