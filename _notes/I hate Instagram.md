I'm sure  
The city is strong  
Chews me up and swallows  
I'm calm If I can speak things stuck in my mind  
"Friends Team" and "Block Nicotine"  
To sleep through troubled sleep  
The lovely lure may hit you like a bomb  
  
I hate Instagram  
Today I let myself down  
Independent night  
Independent night  
  
I hate Instagram  
Today I let myself down  
Independent night  
My Independent night  
  
I fell in love with you  
  
I know I look stupid now  
All your desires I kill  
Like a song that I don’t listen to  
Like a song that I can’t listen to  
Like a song that I no longer hear  
She revealed the secret  
  
I hate Instagram  
Today I let myself down  
Independent night  
Independent night  
  
I hate Instagram  
Today I let myself down  
Independent night  
My Independent night  
  
Hey  
I'm sleeping  
Get me from under my skin?  
How many times was I close to death?  
Sounds very queer?  
Add volume in your ears  
Thank you for showing me more and I say yes  
  
We are sailing on a ship blessed by the devil
