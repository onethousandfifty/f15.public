He keeps a patient's record
Who is watching me?
One of six flavors to cherish
I have it all on tape

My subtle body is out of place
It’s like an energy
New energy
How cool am I?

Reach for your neck (x8)
Change the target (x8)
Making mistakes (x8)
You're just a sucker (x8)

He keeps a patient's record
Who is watching me?
One of six flavors to cherish
I have it all on tape

My subtle body still out of place
It’s like an energy
New energy

He keeps a patient's record
Who is watching me?
One of six flavors to cherish
I have it all on tape

My subtle body still out of place
It’s like an energy
New energy
Make the energy fade
