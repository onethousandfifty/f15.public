I’m so scared  
I was a mistake  
Death sits in the seat next to me  
Love is so short  
Forgetting is so long  
Never give up, never get old

Soft boy, I’m sorry  
Impossible to love me  
Impossible to deal with me  
Seen as it’s impossible to be nice to me

Your style poison  
I’m not a girl I’m poison

In the red neon light  
You look like death  
You also look beautiful  
You can leave me  
Nothing has happened here  
Now you wanna focus  
Before you think I’m an angel.

Soft boy, I’m sorry  
Impossible to love me  
Impossible to deal with me  
Seen as it’s impossible to be nice to me

Your style poison  
I’m not a girl I’m poison

Slow-acting poison

Please  
Found this bad boy in the yard  
Please  
Survive in a plane crash after a kiss  
She says I look pretty in pink  
Come near me  
Skateboard, not my friend,  
Wow, friend  
Bingo
