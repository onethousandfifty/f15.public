I will show my spoiled tastes 
So that everyone finally calmed down Probably you never went crazy Unfortunately, ask you for one 

Repeat that 
I'm not your destiny 
Repeat that 
Leaving it as it is 
Repeat that 
All you want is now exist 
Repeat that 
Repeat that

I will show my warped nature 
Face that only a mother could love I'm tired of being fucked by the fickle finger of fate 
Even a stopped clock is right twice a day 

Repeat that 
I'm not your destiny 
Repeat that 
Leaving it as it is 
Repeat that 
All you want is now exist 
Repeat that 
Repeat that 

I'd like to have some good luck for once

Entertainment propaganda 
Charts are drawn up for idiots 
Where is its output? 
Good reasons for this decision 
Prince of darkness 
Launches an epidemic 
And each heatwave 

To save all the extinct stars 
I will not be enough 

Repeat that 
I'm not your destiny 
Repeat that 
Leaving it as it is 
Repeat that 
All you want is now exist
Repeat that 
Repeat that
