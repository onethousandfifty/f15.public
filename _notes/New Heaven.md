There is no you 
It's just a console 
Sadness that you'll 
Never be able to know 
Father said, the father did 
Pretty bossy 
To say you lost me 
Conversation that you compulsively play out in your head 
I knew it 

Sitting back, spring-fired shotgun Stroke the nape of the neck 
You should see I'm trying so hard 
But don't have a feedback 

When are you gonna pick me up, dad? 
Faces who watching me on TV is dead 
Your beautiful lady on cocaine, okay New day
New heaven 
I never look is cool, as always thought 

Senseless I'm dying in the black 
The moment could be endless 
I felt it, and she felt me 
And that's how I feel envy 
Tornado Alley 
Has closed on the key 
Current problems I would hug you But I'm just a text 

When are you gonna pick me up, dad? 
Faces who watching me on TV is dead 
Your beautiful lady on cocaine, okay New day 
New heaven 
A new day is a new heaven 

And a time to heal
Clear the text 
A film I made 
Bye Blissful peace and balance Goodbye 
Risk must be taken 

Make me happy again 
To pretend
