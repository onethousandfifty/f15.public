Echoes may wait 
Smashing my own face 
Hate to see all these ways

I see a dream that explains everything 
And I shoot off into the distance of my imagination

Here's your nickname 
As in the book of complaints 
And a smile flows through my veins

I try to lie while the mercury spills 
Fucking creature didn't save me
