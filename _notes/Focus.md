Adenoidal fruity voice 
Cut off frequency 
We flush with cash 
To Kilimanjaro in 1986 Camry 
I twist out you all on the middle finger 
Sit tight, sleep tight 
Safety drive 
Listen to Hi-Fi, put your zipper up, Hey 
Foresee a goldfish 
Be cheeky 
Stop picturing the girl with club coca Typical fake song 
Taste like heartburn & soda 

Girl, I focus on your eyes
Girl, I focus on your eyes I have a high IQ Like Alba Galocha 
Girl, I focus on your eyes I’m a big multi shipper 
See you in Paris 

Jerk off on the Emma Watson nude The Cheshire Cat has its own point of view 
Face to face with your stupid favorite song 
Blow your nose in the gate to another world 
It’s a good idea 
In the practice of palmistry
Do a little bit quiet kick in the beginning 
The officer pursued 
Shirtless charisma scat singing 
If I’m not mistaken 
Everything depends on an angle Guess why? 

Girl, I focus on your eyes 
Girl, I focus on your eyes 
I have a high IQ Like Alba Galocha Girl, I focus on your eyes 
I’m a big multi shipper 
See you in Paris 

Breathing, she’s still breathing 
Me neither 
Just choose another day 
The song played 
If I remember rightly 
When you cried last night 
Drone pictures can astonish 
Creep out all your friends 
I killing time on Fiverr 
To tie up any loose ends 

Fireworks supermarket 
Dancing like my father drunk 
Create one-man band 
Trying to get loopholes to her bed Liars were in power 
Search for missed keys in a "Silent Hill" 
I’ll never meet you again 
No way 
Pizza punk pick a fate
