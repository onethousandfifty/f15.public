Confession of an inferior person
He doesn't understand what he's doing
He's so tired he's trapped in himself

Today he listened to his own voice and fell in love with it
For so many years he denied that he was beautiful
And these thoughts gave him freedom to compose a song 
Free from the image that locked him in the cage of social pressure 
Admit to yourself that style is when you trust yourself 

When you trust yourself 
When you trust yourself 
When you trust yourself 
When you trust
