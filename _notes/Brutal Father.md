Skin deep 
So to speak 
And figure out 
Seismic shift with cum shots 
Wave your hand above 

Cynical parents kill a twin in the womb 
Don’t be surprised I started showing symptoms 

Feast your eyes on this freaky fella Nightmare, stick out one’s chest Whatever
I’m doing it wrong again

I find it kind of sad 
Bodies in space are upset 
Survive in the face of new threats Out-of-place memories 
Remind the genius 
Incredibly serious 
Our false is dangerous 
No second chance 

Leave me, brother 
Fixed line, thrombus 
Golden father I like this way get old Brutal father 
Unexpected clever 
And ridiculous lover 
Getting touch 

Brutal Father
