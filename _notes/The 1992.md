I asked God for a bike crash 
She is a bitch 
The next new wave is weird as you Custom-made “Courtney Love” Deserve more 
You will be dead soon enough Success anyway 
Terrible face like the elephant man Tired vs rested voice of Elvis Presley Your friend writes well tracks 

The 1992 
The tiny gun makes a tiny boom 
Evil-eye on the birthday cake 
Hold a camera above sea level 
The 1992 
She dresses in a toothpaste costume And never feel discomfort 
You can play it as you want

Posters of naked ladies and Dendy cartridges here 
Sincere and empty 
It will keep you inspired 
Death of the outsider
I wish you lonely 

The 1992 
The tiny gun makes a tiny boom 
Evil-eye on the birthday cake 
Hold a camera above sea level 
The 1992 
She dresses in a toothpaste costume And never feel discomfort 
You can play it as you want 

Your stupid game never ends Success anyway 
Spent the day in the bed 
Drinks with old school friends
Was the most traumatic 

But you know that I am yours 

Death of the outsider 
Gloomy, ugly 

The 1992 
The tiny gun makes a tiny boom 
Evil-eye on the birthday cake 
Hold a camera above sea level 
The 1992 
She dresses in a toothpaste costume And never feel discomfort 
You can play it as you want
